              This was a lot of fun to make on my own, but I&apos;d prefer to

                  TableTalk is a front-end interface for managing and
                  interacting with data from a back-end database. The interface
                  supports all CRUD operations. Data that is displayed can be
                  filtered by field and value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The interface was originally designed for inventory management
                  but can be used with JSON data of any shape. The deployed
                  website uses placeholder seed data generated with ChatGPT, so
                  please feel free to try out the CRUD tools!

                  Grow-grub is a full-stack companion app for gardeners that was
                  developed as our final group project at Dev Academy. The app
                  helps users plan their gardens, track plant progress, and
                  provides care instructions and harvesting tips. It also
                  monitors watering schedules and generates reminders based on
                  each plant&apos;s needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project was completed in one week by myself and six other
                  developers. We were working right up until code freeze, so
                  there are some features that are yet to be implemented!

                  This a simulation that models gravitational interactions
                  between multiple bodies in a 2D space. The simulation
                  visualises the movement of the bodies over time, and you can
                  get some cool patterns and chaotic motion if the initial
                  conditions are right. Try running the sim with N=5 at 50,000
                  steps a few times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The simulation does not model collisions between bodies, so
                  they tend fly off at extreme angles when they get close to one
                  another. It also isn&apos;t optimised and the time complexity
                  is proportional to N squared, so be careful!
