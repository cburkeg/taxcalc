The tax calculator is built with a couple of assumptions/limitations:

* The effective tax rate that is displayed is the effective tax rate for your net income (i.e. including your PAYE income.) In comparison, the effective tax rate used in Hnry's calculator is specifically for self-employed/other income.
* The ACC earner levy is only calculated from self-employed income and ignores any contributions you might make from your PAYE income. 
* The ACC work levy is calculated using an average of $1 per $100 - in reality, this would depend on the sole trader's business. 
* The calculator uses tax brackets from 2025/2026, but the 2024 student loan repayment threshold is used.
